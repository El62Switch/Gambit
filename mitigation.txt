[2025-05-23 22:45:04] SSH Attack from 192.168.0.1
NIM Analysis: Here's a brief threat report:

**Risk Level: High**
**Recommended Action: Block**
**Explanation:** An automated SSH attack from IP address 192.168.0.1 has been detected, resulting in multiple failed login attempts. Given the nature of the attack, it is likely an attempt to brute-force a weak SSH password. This type of attack can be a precursor to unauthorized access to the system, allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges and potentially execute malicious activities.

In cases where the IP address is not within a trusted subnet and the frequency of failed attempts is high, it is likely a malicious actor attempting to exploit a weak password. Therefore, blocking the IP address from further attempts is the recommended course of action to prevent potential security breaches.
Action: Blocked
